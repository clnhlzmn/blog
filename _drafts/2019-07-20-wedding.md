I proposed to Kaitlin around the middle of August 2018. I was nervous. Thankfully she said yes. I wasn't surprised; we had discussed marriage. I had asked her dad for permission the previous day so I think she saw it coming.

Here she is at Addison Oaks when we were searching for a location:

We didn't end up having the wedding at Addison Oaks. After a cool farm location fell through we decided to go with the Scarab Club in Detroit.

The Scarab Club is an awesome art gallery right behind the DIA. When we visited the first time the exhibit was of gross conditions in restaurants by a former health inspector. Athough it was interesting we didn't think it would be appropriate for our wedding. Fortunately the exhibit on the big day was more appropriate:
