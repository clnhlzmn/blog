CopperKitten is an exercise in programming language and runtime design and implementation. Check out the [code]. 

This project is far from complete. I am writing this post to introduce what I have done so far and invite comments and discussion.

I have a few goals for this project.

1. Expand my knowledge of programming language design and implementation

2. Implement a high level programming language that can run on small (Atmel AVR) processors
