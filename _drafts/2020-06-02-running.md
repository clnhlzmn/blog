I have been running regularly for about 13 years now (I'm 31 now). It started for me as a necessity when I joined the Air Force in 2007. Before that I didn't run. That wasn't because I was opposed to it or that I was out of shape. I just didn't really think of it. Granted, I was a teen and I didn't believe that I had to put effort into fitness. I had a fast metabolism and I was always walking or riding my bike for fun and transportation. I just assumed that would always be my natural state and I didn't understand why people would run on purpose.

When I started basic training, however, I started running whether I wanted to or not. That was an exciting time for me. I felt like I had discovered the joy of running. It shouldn't have been a surprise to me. I was used to pushing myself on my bicycles.
