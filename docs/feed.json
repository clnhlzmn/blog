            "content_text": "I have been trying to be more thorough in my testing efforts lately. What has always seemed like a big challenge is how to automate testing for source code that is targeting a microcontroller like AVR? I will talk about two sides of this challenge: decoupling and running unit tests.DecouplingI write a lot of code for AVR microcontrollers so the code here will be in that context, but these ideas work equally well for any target. Decoupling means to separate your software into small pieces that are coupled only with a small number of dependencies. A dependency could be a target header file like avr/io.h or it could be another software module that you have written. In either case, keeping the number of dependencies small will improve your chances of successful unit testing.Assume you have a module called relay_control which is intended to turn a relay on if an input value exceeds a threshold and off otherwise. Your relay_control.c file might look like this:#include &lt;avr/io.h&gt;#define THRESHOLD (100)void relay_control(int value) {    if (value &gt; THRESHOLD) {        PORTA |= 1;    } else {        PORTA &amp;= ~1;    }}The relay_control function takes value, compares it to THRESHOLD, and sets bit zero of PORTA high or low accordingly (assuming PA0 is somehow controlling the relay). Of course this is a trivially simple function but imagine some other complicated logic in it’s place. One way to test this function is to compile this using GCC on your development machine while somehow including a mock avr/io.h that defines PORTA in such a way that the test code can determine if the relay is on or off for a range of the value argument passed to relay_control. That requires you to mock the header file which is not always possible. A better way is to use features of the C language to decouple the direct io port access from relay_control so that the relay_control module doesn’t depend on avr/io.h. That way you can test it on your development machine or wherever you want. The new relay_control.c could look something like this:#define THRESHOLD (100)void (*relay_writer)(char relay_on);void relay_control(int value) {    if (relay_writer)         relay_writer(value &gt; THRESHOLD);}The new relay_control.c doesn’t depend on avr/io.h. Instead it depends on a function pointer, relay_writer, that acts as an interface to the hardware. Now the application can implement relay_writer to access the hardware, and your test code can implement it to set a bit in memory to allow you to check the output of the relay_control module. Your application could implement relay_writer like this (perhaps in relay_control_hal.c [relay control hardware abstraction layer]):#include &lt;avr/io.h&gt;extern void (*relay_writer)(char relay_on);void relay_writer_impl(char relay_on) {    if (relay_on) {        PORTA |= 1;    } else {        PORTA &amp;= ~1;    }}void relay_control_init(void) {    relay_writer = relay_writer_impl;}The hardware abstraction layer code is purposfully kept as trivial as possible, it’s only accessing the io port, because the only way to test it is to run it on the target platform (because it depends on avr/io.h). Since it’s so simple you’re not as concerned with testing relay_control_hal.c (trivial hardware access only) as you are with relay_control.c (non-trivial application logic).Now you can write a test, test_relay_control.c, that might look like this:#include &lt;assert.h&gt;#include \"relay_control.h\"char relay_state = 0;void relay_writer_test_impl(char relay_on) {    relay_state = relay_on;}extern void (*relay_writer)(char relay_on);int main(void) {    relay_writer = relay_writer_test_impl;    relay_control(0);    assert(relay_state == 0);    relay_control(1000);    assert(relay_state == 1);    return 0;}Decoupling relay_control.c from the hardware (avr/io.h) has the added benefit that your tests are not constrained by the target environment’s memory or processor limitations. The tests can use the full power of the C language.Now whenever you make a change to relay_control.c you can quickly run the test to make sure that the functionality remains. But how do you run the test?Running unit testsOne way is to use a simple makefile that compiles test_relay_control.c and relay_control.c and then runs the resulting executable. Or you could use a more advanced build system generator like CMake. I recommend using CMake because it gets very tricky very quickly to link up a bunch of .c and .h files in different directories to create an executable with only a makefile. I have only recently learned how to use CMake so please bear with me on this. The solution that I have come up with for running unit tests on windows goes like this:      create a directory somewhere in your project called test        in the test directory create a file called cmakelists.txt    cmakelists.txt:     cmake_minimum_required (VERSION 3.18) project(Test) enable_testing() add_executable(Test      test_relay_control.c      &lt;path to relay_control.c&gt; ) include_directories(&lt;path to relay_control.h&gt;) add_test(NAME Test COMMAND Test)    In this case there is only one test called Test which is generated by the add_executable and add_test commands.    To add another test you would first create your test file another_test.c and add the following lines to cmakelists.txt     add_executable(AnotherTest      another_test.c      &lt;path to another_file_under_test.c&gt; ) include_directories(&lt;path to headers needed by another_test.c&gt;) add_test(NAME AnotherTest COMMAND AnotherTest)        in the test directory create a file called test.sh    test.sh:     if ! [[ -d \"build\" ]]; then     mkdir build fi cd build cmake .. -G\"MinGW Makefiles\" cmake --build . &amp;&amp; ctest -C Debug    In this case I am using the MinGW Makefiles generator for CMake because I run my tests on Windows but I would like to use GCC rather than the default MSVC.  With those steps having been done you can now run test.sh and whatever tests you have defined will be run and the output will show you clearly which have passed and which have failed.Happy testing!",

            "content_text": "Making bread is a great hobby. It’s can be as simple as you want. It’s delicious. There is infinite room for experimenting and improving your recipes and technique. Until a few weeks ago I had never tried to make bread beyond things like bananna or zuchinni bread. Then someone at work started talking to me about sourdough starter and I decided to try it. Turns out it’s not that hard.I started by making a starter. Since I got my starter working I have made a few loaves from different recipes and they have all turned out great.Making the starterI followed a recipe from King Arthur Flour to make my starter. I used this one because it was one of the simpler ones that I had found.Side note: Something I notice with a lot of sourdough related content on the internet is that a lot of it is very intimidating. It can be hard to find recipes that don’t make it overly complicated. I think the one for starter from KA Flour above is good in that respect. I have found that the process is more forgiving than it might at first appear.Basically to create a starter you mix equal parts flour and water together, adding more daily, until the wild yeast and other critters that live naturally in the flour start to thrive. I started my starter with bleached all purpose flour and filtered water from my reverse osmosis filter. I didn’t have as much activity as the KA recipe said I should after the first few days and I’m not sure if that was because of the bleached flour or not, but regardless after a while I switched to unbleached AP and now my starter (a few weeks old) is very active.I followed the KA starter recipe for about two weeks. For about the first week I was only adding flour and water and then once I had built up a good amount of starter I began discarding about half before feeding. At first I was feeding it every 24 hours. I noticed at the end of 24 hours that a brown liquid began to form on the surface of the starter. That is an alcohol waste product that is created by the critters in the starter. I have read that when you see hooch it means your starter is hungry. At that point I started feeding my starter every 12 hours and I don’t get the hooch anymore.Now I keep my starter in the fridge. Doing that slows its metabolism and allows me feed it only once a week. I have been baking every week so it has worked out well. My process goes something like this: A day or two before I would like to start baking I take the starter out of the fridge. At this point it has been in there about 5 or 6 days and is hungry. I usually have about 200 g of starter at this point. I’ll take half (100 g) and add equal parts water (filtered) and flour (unbleached AP). I do that two or three times (every 12 hours). So if I want to bake on Saturday I’ll take the starter out of the fridge Friday morning and feed it. Then I’ll feed it Friday night and Saturday morning. Then by mid-day Saturday the starter has been fed three times and is ready to use. Ideally I will use about half of the starter for my bake and feed the other half and put it back in the fridge ready for next week.Baking sourdoughOnce I have my active fed starter (mid-day Saturday) it’s time to bake. If you have looked at some sourdough bread recipes you might be a little overwhelmed. In my opinion a lot of them are overly complicated like the starter recipes. What I can gather is the essence of sourdough bread is flour, water, salt, and active starter. There are a lot of people out there measuring out ingredients to the tenth of a gram and other … In my, admittedly limited, experience, it’s not that critical.A simple recipe that has worked well for me came from a video by Patrick Ryan on Youtube called How To Make Sourdough Bread Masterclass. I have reproduced the recipe in text form below for people like me who hate following video instructions. You should check out the video anyway because there is a lot of good info.Even that video, though, talks about doing things like baking the bread in a dutch oven or using pans of water to get just the right amount of steam. Now I’m sure that there are reasons for doing those things that the artisan baker would notice, but in my experience just plopping the dough on a baking sheet and putting it in the oven for 30 minutes makes a damn good loaf of bread. No dutch oven or fancy steaming required.When I learn something new I like to break it down to it’s simplest form so that I can really learn how it works. Something that has troubled me about a lot of the sourdough recipes I have found online is that they make it hard to understand the essence of sourdough (flour, water, salt, starter). I like Patrick Ryan’s video and recipe because he keeps it simple and unpretentious. It’s just bread and it’s really not that hard.Sourdough recipe from Patrick Ryan’s videoingredients  320 g starter  800 g strong flour  460 ml water  10 g saltdirections  mix flour, water, salt, and starter roughly in a bowl  dump it on the counter  knead (should be sticky) until dough can be streched to translucent  place in a bowl to rise for 3 hours  re-form dough into a round ball (knock all the air from it)  divide dough ball into two halves  shape halves into round balls (fold to form round shape, then drag on counter to tighten skin)  place halves in a flour dusted proving basket or bowl for 3 hours or overnight in the fridge (dough should not collapse when touched, should be “on the rise”)  score the loaves  bake covered at 450 F for 25 minutes or until looking yummy",

Then by mid-day Saturday the starter has been fed three times and is ready to use. Ideally I will use about half of the starter for my bake and feed the other half and put it back in the fridge ready for next week.</p><h3 id=\"baking-sourdough\">Baking sourdough</h3><p>Once I have my active fed starter (mid-day Saturday) it’s time to bake. If you have looked at some sourdough bread recipes you might be a little overwhelmed. In my opinion a lot of them are overly complicated like the starter recipes. What I can gather is the essence of sourdough bread is flour, water, salt, and active starter. There are a lot of people out there measuring out ingredients to the tenth of a gram and other … In my, admittedly limited, experience, it’s not that critical.</p><p>A simple recipe that has worked well for me came from a video by Patrick Ryan on Youtube called <a href=\"https://youtu.be/2FVfJTGpXnU\">How To Make Sourdough Bread Masterclass</a>. I have reproduced the recipe in text form below for people like me who hate following video instructions. You should check out the video anyway because there is a lot of good info.</p><p>Even that video, though, talks about doing things like baking the bread in a dutch oven or using pans of water to get just the right amount of steam. Now I’m sure that there are reasons for doing those things that the artisan baker would notice, but in my experience just plopping the dough on a baking sheet and putting it in the oven for 30 minutes makes a damn good loaf of bread. No dutch oven or fancy steaming required.</p><p>When I learn something new I like to break it down to it’s simplest form so that I can really learn how it works. Something that has troubled me about a lot of the sourdough recipes I have found online is that they make it hard to understand the essence of sourdough (flour, water, salt, starter). I like Patrick Ryan’s video and recipe because he keeps it simple and unpretentious. It’s just bread and it’s really not that hard.</p><h3 id=\"sourdough-recipe-from-patrick-ryans-video\">Sourdough recipe from Patrick Ryan’s video</h3><h4 id=\"ingredients\">ingredients</h4><ul>  <li>320 g starter</li>  <li>800 g strong flour</li>  <li>460 ml water</li>  <li>10 g salt</li></ul><h4 id=\"directions\">directions</h4><ol>  <li>mix flour, water, salt, and starter roughly in a bowl</li>  <li>dump it on the counter</li>  <li>knead (should be sticky) until dough can be streched to translucent</li>  <li>place in a bowl to rise for 3 hours</li>  <li>re-form dough into a round ball (knock all the air from it)</li>  <li>divide dough ball into two halves</li>  <li>shape halves into round balls (fold to form round shape, then drag on counter to tighten skin)</li>  <li>place halves in a flour dusted proving basket or bowl for 3 hours or overnight in the fridge (dough should not collapse when touched, should be “on the rise”)</li>  <li>score the loaves</li>  <li>bake covered at 450 F for 25 minutes or until looking yummy</li></ol>",

            "content_text": "Kaitlin and I decided to go to Marseille for our honeymoon. We probably could have started planning earlier, and planned more, but in the end it was an amazing time.Day 1        Kaitlin and I arriving at our AirbnbWe stayed at a wonderful loft apartment hosted by Agnès. It was in a cool old building (like most buildings there) with three or four apartments that Agnès rented out. We arrived at the apartment around 11:00 am. It wasn’t ready yet, but Agnès gave us refreshments (it was hot) and pointed out interesting areas of the city on some maps. As we waited for her to get the apartment ready we walked to a nearby restaurant, Monsieur Madame, for lunch. After lunch we walked to le Vieux-Port de Marseille (the Old Port of Marseille). It’s the main port in the center of the city.        Kaitlin and I under the mirror cieling at le Vieux-PortWe checked out the shops and scenery at la Vieux-Port and then walked back to the apartment to get some rest after a long day travelling.        Kaitlin at the front door of Maison PépouzeWhen we got back to the apartment Agnès had set up our budget air conditioner. It was a frozen water bottle, sitting in a tray to catch the condensation, in front of a fan. This was when it set in that the apartment didn’t have air conditioning and it was in the 90s (30 C). We were tired enough that it didn’t matter.Day 2We woke up with croissants and pain au chocolat (literally chocolate bread but more like chocolate croissants). It’s a French stereotype, but this was a common breakfast over there. We made some espresso, ate, and started getting ready for the day. We started with a short walk to a bus station near the appartment. The bus arrived and I awkwardly bought tickets from the driver (deux billet š’il vous plaît). We rode that bus for a few minutes and got off where we were supposed to transfer to another bus, but we decided to take rental scooters instead. A 15 minute scooter ride and another short bus ride later and we arrived at Callelongue, a small town at the Southern tip of Marseille on the edge of Parc national des Calanques. The calanques are basically narrow, steep walled inlets along the Mediterranean coast. We stopped for some sparkling water and then started hiking.        Kaitlin looking amazing at Parc national des CalanquesWe hiked for a while, relaxed at a secluded beach (Calanque de Marseilleveyre), and then hiked back to Callelongue where we caught the same busses back to the aparment. Later that night we got dinner at a super cute Egyptian restaurant. I had a whole fish.        Kaitlin at La Cantine de Nour d'EgyptDay 3After we woke we walked to a nearby bakery to get the French breakfast. Unfortunately, we were late and they were out of croissants! Oh well. We got a baguette instead. Another French stereotype that is based in at least a little truth is the popularity of the baguette. I guess about one in every four people we saw on the street was carrying or actively eating a baguette. After breakfast we took scooters to MuCEM (Museum of Civilizations of Europe and the Mediterranean). It is a beautiful building in a beautiful location and the exhibits were interesting too.The oldest district in the city, Le Panier, is adjacent to the museum. After we left the museum we walked around Le Panier for a while. Most of Marseille feels old, but Le Panier especially so. The streets are too narrow for cars and mostly paved with blocks. There are a lot of interesting shops and restaurants packed in. We made dinner reservations at a highly rated restaurant Au Coeur du Panier (in the heart of the basket), and then got lunch at an African place, Marafiki Coin Tropical, where the best they had for Kait was some kind of a salad, but I got another whole fish with fried plantains (yum).        Kaitlin at Marafiki Coin TropicalAfter lunch we checked out the nearby mall (Les Terrasses Du Port) which aside from being gigantic was a pretty standard and boring mall. We got ice cream and took the tram back to the apartment for a nap. Later that day we went back down to Le Panier for our dinner. I had Coquilles St Jacques snackées (scallops) and Kait had some kind of cheesy potatoes. A little wandering and a tram ride later and we were back at the apartment for bed.Day 4Croissants for breakfast again, followed by a bus ride to the rental car place to pick up our rental. We had planned a trip for the next day, but were picking up the car a day early. The car we got was a little 5 speed Peugeot that was a blast to drive. Driving in Marseille was nerve wracking, but once we were on the highway it was not very different from driving in the United States. We headed from the car rental to Cassis, a smaller town just east of Marseille. Cassis is known for its wine making and the road overlooking the wineries when driving in was great. We weren’t there for the wine though. We stopped at a store for supplies, found a parking spot as close as possible, and started hiking toward a calanque on the East end of Parc national des Calanques called Calanque d’En-Vau. This calanque is particularly beautiful, but also quite secluded. The hike was long and hot so it felt great to relax on the beach and swim a little.        On the beach at Calanque d'En-VauThe hike back to the car finished us off and we went back to the apartment for sleep. We still hadn’t fully recovered from the flight at this point.Day 5Friday morning we had our typical breakfast of croissants and espresso earlier than usual and then started driving toward Lourmarin, a small town about an hour north of Marseille. In preparation for this trip one of the things we did was watch Anthony Bourdain’s Parts Unknown episode in Marseille. Of course he checks out a lot of restaurants in the city, some of which we also put on our list, but he also rented a car (his car was much cooler than ours) and drove to Lourmarin for the Friday morning market. Driving through the French countryside was a beautiful and fun. The market at Lourmarin was amazing. We bought some gifts for people back home like olive oil, honey, and ginger, and we bought ourselves some treats.        Kaitlin shopping in LourmarinWe said bye to Lourmarin and headed back to Marseille. One of the places Anthony Bourdain recommended was a food truck called Pizza JD. We grabbed some pizza and started driving into the national park to check out Calanque De Morgiou. It took an interesting drive down a narrow, winding mountain road to get there. There was a cute town at the end of the road on the water. We parked there and walked to a private spot on the rocks where we ate our pizza, swam a little, and watched the sunset.        Sunset at Calanque De MorgiouDay 6On day 6 we dropped the car off and walked around the Basilique Notre-Dame-de-la-Garde. It’s a giant, old curch on a hight point. There are small model boats hanging from the ceiling inside. I guess sailors used to leave them as tribute to the mother of Christ who saved them from shipwreck. Notre-Dame-de-la-Garde still has bullet holes from WW2.        View from Notre-Dame-de-la-GardeDay 7Day 7 was spent mostly walking around the area around Vieux Port. We got lunch at another Anthony Bourdain recommended restaurant Le Fémina.Day 8This was the most interesting day for me. We had our usual breakfast at the apartment, took the tram to Vieux-Port, had second breakfast at a cute little cafe overlooking the port, and then boarded the Goelette Alliance.        On the Goelette AllianceThe Alliance is an old fishing boat turned sail boat that goes out for tours of the Mediterranean coast near Marseille. We set out, motoring and not sailing, around 10:30 am and headed east. At about 1 pm we arrived at Calanque de Sugiton. The Alliance provided a tasty cold lunch and we took some time to swim. At this point in the trip the temperature had dropped a lot and the water was now too cool for me, but I did get in for at least a few seconds.        On the Goelette AllianceAfter the break we started heading back to Marseille. On the way we passed close to Château d’If, where part of the novel The Count of Monte Cristo was set. Later that night we failed a second time to eat at Bourdain’s recommended Cafe de L’Abbaye (didn’t serve dinner) so we got Italian instead.Day 10Day 10 was mostly spent finding gifts for people back home. We got some cool prints from Le Typo du Panier and a few bottles of wine from Cassis. Finally we were able to get lunch at Cafe de L’Abbaye. That night we packed up for the trip back home.Marseille is a great place to visit. I would highly recommend checking it out. Thanks for reading.See more photos here.",

            "content_text": "I proposed to Kaitlin around the middle of August 2018. I was nervous. Thankfully she said yes. I wasn’t surprised; we had discussed marriage. I had asked her dad for permission the previous day so I think she saw it coming. We decided to have the wedding in the Summer of 2019 and started looking for locations immediately.        Kaitlin and I at Cliff Bells not long after getting engagedWe looked at a few locations and decided to have the wedding and reception at the Scarab Club in Detroit. It’s an awesome art gallery right behind the DIA.        Scarab Club front doorWe have all heard nightmare stories about wedding planning, but I am lucky and Kaitlin is amazing. She handled mostly everything with relatively little stress. It all came together just right as the day approached.        Invite and ringsFinally the day had arrived. When we first visited the gallery the exhibit was photos of gross conditions in restaurants taken by a former health inspector. It was interesting but not wedding material. Fortunately the exhibit for our day was more appropriate:        Wedding day exhibitKaitlin’s day started earlier than mine. She had a lot more preparation to do. She had her hair, makeup, and nails done and arrived at the Scarab Club looking beautiful and started the finishing touches.        Kaitlin getting ready        Still getting ready...        Ready!I arrived shortly after she did and after I nervously helped set up tables and chairs I too went upstairs to get ready.        My dad helping with my cuff linksWhen we were both ready I waited in the lounge for Kaitlin so we could get some first look photos. I couldn’t believe my eyes! She was even more stunning than usual. These are some of our favorite photos from the day.        First lookThen it was time for the ceremony. All our guests were seated in the garden, and our amazing officiant Josh was waiting at the altar. We hadn’t rehearsed anything, but even so the ceremony went smoothly. We started the music (La Vie En Rose by Louis Armstrong), I walked out and down to Josh, then Kaitlin’s dad guided her to me.        Beginning of the ceremonyJosh had a few well chosen words, Kaitlin and I exchanged vows and rings, and then we kissed as husband and wife!        Husband and wifeAfter the ceremony Kaitlin and I signed our marriage certificate and took some time for family photos. When we were done with that we made our entrance to the gallery as husband and wife and we each had a glass of sparkling juice. Then our friend Ang announced our first dance and started the music (Never In My Wildest Dreams by Dan Aurbach) and we started our dance. This was one of the best parts of the day for me. A friend had taught us a few rumba moves to do and we had a blast showing off to everyone. It was very special.        First danceThen Kaitlin danced with her dad and I danced with my mom.        Father daughter dance        Mother son danceAfter the special dances we all went upstairs to the lounge for cake. Our cake was a two tier plain cheesecake accompanied by raspberry and fudge swirl cheesecakes. It was amazing. I was tempted to smash a piece in Kait’s face, but I was chicken.        Cake cuttingI was very nervous for everything up to this point. It felt like a performance that Kait and I were putting on. We planned and practiced which helped me feel more confident but that feeling never left. After cutting the cake I felt relief that the scripted part of the day was over.

            "content_text": "CopperKitten is an exercise in programming language and runtime design and implementation. Check out the code here and read on for more explanation.This project is far from complete. It will probably never be fully complete. I have a few features that I would like to implement before I put it aside. I am writing this post to introduce what I have done so far and invite comments and discussion.CK is a simple functional language with Hindley Milner type inference. Its compiler and assembler are currently implemented in Kotlin. The compiler (ckc), for now, compiles a single ‘script’ file to its corresponding portable assembly listing, and then the assembler (cka) assembles that listing to a portable C99 program. An example of this can be seen in the makefile here. Using the makefile requires java and gcc. The script simple_io.ck is intended to illustrate features of the language that have been implemented so far.The LanguageBuilt-in TypesThere are three built in types in CK: Unit, Int, and Fun(A, ..., R). The first is the usual unit type with exactly one value. The second is a signed integer implemented by the C type intptr_t. The third type Fun(A, ..., R) is the function type where A, ... represents argument types and R is the return type. The function type can also be written as (A, ...) R.User Defined TypesUsers can define their own types using a type ... declaration at the beginning of a CK file. For example the declaration type List = (A) nil() | cons(A, List(A)) creates the type List(A) where A can be any type. User defined types are implemented as a number of compiler generated functions. Pattern matching, when implemented, will use these functions behind the scenes. Until then, the programmer can use them to construct and deconstruct values of user defined types.CK ProgramsFor now a CK program consists of a single .ck file. A .ck file is zero or more declarations followed by an expression. In the grammar there are two types of declaration, but for now only typeDecl is implemented. The type declarations cause a number of functions to be implemented by the compiler for use in the following expression. Evaluation of the expression in the .ck file is evaluation of the CK program. In the future I would like to add support for multiple files.ExpressionsThe grammar of expressions includes      unit    ()        integers    0, 1, 1000000000000000        all the usual unary and binary operations on integers    a + b, -42, a || (b &lt;&gt; c)    All unary and binary operators take arguments of type Int and return values of type Int        functions    (a) a, (a, b) a + b, (n) n * n    CK supports limited tail call optimization. For a function call in tail position, if the callee has the same number of arguments as the caller, then the stack frame is reused, otherwise the call will create a new stack frame.        function applications    id(42), add(1, 2), map(aList, (e) e * e)    CK uses eager evaluation.        two forms of conditional expression    cond() ? true() : false()    if (cond()) true() else false()    if (cond()) true()    Consequent and alternate expressions of a conditional expression must have the same type. An if without an else has type Unit (that means the consequent must have type Unit). Condition expressions must have type Int where 0 is false and 1 is true, for now. I intend to add a true boolean type at some point.        sequence expressions    { a; b }    a is evaluated and its result discarded, then b is evaluated and its value is the value of { a; b }.        and let expressions    let id = (a) a, let rec forever = (f) { f(); forever(f) }, { let id = (a) a; id(42) }    The scope of a let expression is the rest of the expressions in its enclosing sequence. That is {let id = (a) a; id(42)} can be thought of as let id = (a) a in id(42).        tuples and strings are included in the grammar, but they’re not yet implemented  Note that type annotations are not required. For clarity the programmer can annotate the types of let bound variables, functions parameters, and function return types using the : T syntax. For example let id: (A) A = (a: A):A a. Type annotations are not yet fully implemented, but it should be an easy feature to finish. At the moment there are not any situations that require annotations. I would like to add record types and corresponding accessor syntax such as a.b which will, as far as I know, require limited type annotations.C Language BindingsAnother type of function expression is cfun. These can be used any place an ordinary function expression can be used. cfun is used to create a binding to a function defined in C for doing IO and whatever else you would rather do in C. In the example there are two cfuns that are used to read and write characters on stdout/stdin. A cfun looks like cfun id Type where id is the identifier that matches the identifier of the function in C and Type is the type of that function. The native_read and native_write functions are implemented here. The file that defines the native functions must be compiled and linked with the output from ckc/cka (this is illustrated here).ImplementationThe implementation of CK includes a compiler, assembler, and runtime.CompilerThe CK compiler (ckc) takes a single file (program.ck) and compiles it to a CK assembly file (program.cka). Compilation proceeds in a few steps:      Parse program.ck using ANTLR4.    ANTLR4 generates the classes required to parse a CK file based on the grammar ck.g4.        Convert the ast that is produced by ANTLR to a simpler ast that is easier to work with.    The class CkBaseVisitor (generated by ANTLR) is extended here to convert the ANTLR generated ast into a simpler representation. The CkBaseVisitor extensions are used to parse program.ck here and return the simpler ast.        Type check the program.    Type checking is implemented here. The type checker is based on the example implementation at the end of “Basic Polymorphic Typechecking” by Luca Cardelli.        Compile the program.    Compilation is done by the CompilationVisitor class. For now this amounts to visiting the ast and returning a list of assembler instructions.  The command line option parser is used when ckc is invoked on the command line. It parses command line options, reads the input file, performs the compilation steps above, and writes the output to the specified output file.AssemblerThe CK assembler (cka) takes a single program.cka file and converts it to a C99 file. The main task of the assembler is to convert the abstract assembler syntax into a list of concrete bytecodes and literal values to be consumed by the runtime vm. Part of cka’s task is to generate layout functions to be used by the memory management scheme to identify pointers on the stack and in heap allocated objects. Another thing that the assembler does is combine the program bytecode array, generated functions, and other supporting pieces together into a .c file with a main function that initializes the CK runtime and starts execution.I won’t go into too much detail on cka here unless there is interest. It’s pretty boring and mostly self explanatory.The output of cka must be compiled and linked with any files containing definitions of cfuns and with the chosen garbage collection implementation file (one of copying_gc.c, incremental_gc.c, or mark_compact_gc.c). Again, the example makefile demonstrates this.RuntimeThe CK runtime is a simple bytecode interpreter combined with one of three tracing garbage collection implementations. I could have implemented CK by compiling directly to C, rather than using a vm, but I wanted to be able to support tail call optimization and I couldn’t see how to do that in plain C.VMThe CK vm is implemented by vm.h. Opcodes are enumerated in the type enum vm_op_code and are reasonably well documented there. In addition to the usual arithmetic operations there are some for control flow, stack frame management, memory allocation, storing/loading values to/from indices into heap objects/stack frames/function arguments/function captures, and some other miscellaneous operations. Program execution is done by the function vm_execute which simply iterates over the given program array dispatching on each op code.Memory ManagementThere are two copying collectors (one incremental) and one mark compact. I hope they can be used as examples for people who are curious about how garbage collection works. The garbage collectors all depend on gc_interface.h which declares a common set of functions with which the vm can interface with the heap memory. There are probably subtle bugs in the implementations of the garbage collectors. I am most confident in the correctness of the simple copying collector, least confident in the incremental copying collector, and the mark compact collector is somewhere in between.Future WorkThis is work that I would like to do on this project in the future.      clean up, organize, and simplify: compiler, assembler, and runtime source files        integrate programmer type annotations with type checker        strings and tuples        pattern matching on instances of user defined types        modules        implement parser and CLI in Kotlin (removing ANTLR and Apache CLI dependencies)        implement compiler and assembler in functional language like ML (or at least in a functional style in Kotlin)        implement compiler and assembler in CK        generate machine code rather than C99        optimize polymorphic functions to not always use boxed types for integers        lots of other optimizations  Thanks for making it this far!

An <code>if</code> without an <code>else</code> has type <code>Unit</code> (that means the consequent must have type <code>Unit</code>). Condition expressions must have type <code>Int</code> where 0 is false and 1 is true, for now. I intend to add a true boolean type at some point.</p>  </li>  <li>    <p>sequence expressions</p>    <p><code>{ a; b }</code></p>    <p><code>a</code> is evaluated and its result discarded, then <code>b</code> is evaluated and its value is the value of <code>{ a; b }</code>.</p>  </li>  <li>    <p>and let expressions</p>    <p><code>let id = (a) a</code>, <code>let rec forever = (f) { f(); forever(f) }</code>, <code>{ let id = (a) a; id(42) }</code></p>    <p>The scope of a let expression is the rest of the expressions in its enclosing sequence. That is <code>{let id = (a) a; id(42)}</code> can be thought of as <code>let id = (a) a in id(42)</code>.</p>  </li>  <li>    <p>tuples and strings are included in the grammar, but they’re not yet implemented</p>  </li></ul><p>Note that type annotations are not required. For clarity the programmer can annotate the types of let bound variables, functions parameters, and function return types using the <code>: T</code> syntax. For example <code>let id: (A) A = (a: A):A a</code>. Type annotations are not yet fully implemented, but it should be an easy feature to finish. At the moment there are not any situations that <em>require</em> annotations. I would like to add record types and corresponding accessor syntax such as <code>a.b</code> which will, as far as I know, require limited type annotations.</p><h3 id=\"c-language-bindings\">C Language Bindings</h3><p>Another type of function expression is <code>cfun</code>. These can be used any place an ordinary function expression can be used. <code>cfun</code> is used to create a binding to a function defined in C for doing IO and whatever else you would rather do in C. In the <a href=\"https://github.com/clnhlzmn/CopperKitten/blob/master/example/simple/simple_io.ck\">example</a> there are two <code>cfun</code>s that are used to read and write characters on <code>stdout</code>/<code>stdin</code>. A <code>cfun</code> looks like <code>cfun id Type</code> where <code>id</code> is the identifier that matches the identifier of the function in C and <code>Type</code> is the type of that function. The <code>native_read</code> and <code>native_write</code> functions are implemented <a href=\"https://github.com/clnhlzmn/CopperKitten/blob/master/runtime/builtin_cfuns.c\">here</a>. The file that defines the native functions must be compiled and linked with the output from ckc/cka (this is illustrated <a href=\"https://github.com/clnhlzmn/CopperKitten/blob/master/example/simple/makefile\">here</a>).</p><h2 id=\"implementation\">Implementation</h2><p>The implementation of CK includes a compiler, assembler, and runtime.</p><h3 id=\"compiler\">Compiler</h3><p>The CK compiler (<a href=\"https://github.com/clnhlzmn/CopperKitten/blob/master/compiler/ckc/\">ckc</a>) takes a single file (program.ck) and compiles it to a CK assembly file (program.cka). Compilation proceeds in a few steps:</p><ol>  <li>    <p>Parse program.ck using ANTLR4.</p>    <p>ANTLR4 generates the <a href=\"https://github.com/clnhlzmn/CopperKitten/blob/master/compiler/ckc/gen/\">classes</a> required to parse a CK file based on the grammar <a href=\"https://github.com/clnhlzmn/CopperKitten/blob/master/compiler/ckc/grammar/ck.g4\">ck.g4</a>.</p>  </li>  <li>    <p>Convert the ast that is produced by ANTLR to a simpler ast that is easier to work with.</p>    <p>The class CkBaseVisitor (generated by ANTLR) is extended <a href=\"https://github.com/clnhlzmn/CopperKitten/blob/master/compiler/ckc/src/ck/grammar/visitors\">here</a> to convert the ANTLR generated ast into a <a href=\"https://github.com/clnhlzmn/CopperKitten/blob/master/compiler/ckc/src/ck/ast/node/\">simpler representation</a>. The CkBaseVisitor extensions are used to parse program.ck <a href=\"https://github.com/clnhlzmn/CopperKitten/blob/master/compiler/ckc/src/ck/grammar/Parse.kt\">here</a> and return the simpler ast.</p>  </li>  <li>    <p>Type check the program.</p>    <p>Type checking is implemented <a href=\"https://github.com/clnhlzmn/CopperKitten/blob/master/compiler/ckc/src/ck/analyze/Analyze.kt\">here</a>. The type checker is based on the example implementation at the end of <a href=\"http://lucacardelli.name/Papers/BasicTypechecking.pdf\">“Basic Polymorphic Typechecking” by Luca Cardelli</a>.</p>  </li>  <li>    <p>Compile the program.</p>    <p>Compilation is done by the <a href=\"https://github.com/clnhlzmn/CopperKitten/blob/master/compiler/ckc/src/ck/ast/visitors/CompilationVisitor.kt\">CompilationVisitor</a> class. For now this amounts to visiting the ast and returning a list of assembler instructions.</p>  </li></ol><p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/clnhlzmn/CopperKitten/blob/master/compiler/ckc/src/ck/Cli.kt\">command line option parser</a> is used when ckc is invoked on the command line. It parses command line options, reads the input file, performs the compilation steps above, and writes the output to the specified output file.</p><h3 id=\"assembler\">Assembler</h3><p>The CK assembler (<a href=\"https://github.com/clnhlzmn/CopperKitten/blob/master/compiler/cka/\">cka</a>) takes a single program.cka file and converts it to a C99 file. The main task of the assembler is to convert the <a href=\"https://github.com/clnhlzmn/CopperKitten/blob/master/compiler/cka/grammar/cka.g4\">abstract assembler syntax</a> into a list of concrete bytecodes and literal values to be consumed by the runtime vm. Part of cka’s task is to generate layout functions to be used by the memory management scheme to identify pointers on the stack and in heap allocated objects. Another thing that the assembler does is combine the program bytecode array, generated functions, and other supporting pieces together into a .c file with a <code>main</code> function that initializes the CK runtime and starts execution.</p><p>I won’t go into too much detail on cka here unless there is interest. It’s pretty boring and mostly self explanatory.</p><p>The output of cka must be compiled and linked with any files containing definitions of <code>cfun</code>s and with the chosen garbage collection implementation file (one of copying_gc.c, incremental_gc.c, or mark_compact_gc.c). Again, the example <a href=\"https://github.com/clnhlzmn/CopperKitten/blob/master/example/simple/makefile\">makefile</a> demonstrates this.</p><h3 id=\"runtime\">Runtime</h3><p>The CK runtime is a simple bytecode interpreter combined with one of three tracing garbage collection implementations. I could have implemented CK by compiling directly to C, rather than using a vm, but I wanted to be able to support tail call optimization and I couldn’t see how to do that in plain C.</p><h4 id=\"vm\">VM</h4><p>The CK vm is implemented by <a href=\"https://github.com/clnhlzmn/CopperKitten/blob/master/runtime/vm.h\">vm.h</a>. Opcodes are enumerated in the type <code>enum vm_op_code</code> and are reasonably well documented there. In addition to the usual arithmetic operations there are some for control flow, stack frame management, memory allocation, storing/loading values to/from indices into heap objects/stack frames/function arguments/function captures, and some other miscellaneous operations. Program execution is done by the function <code>vm_execute</code> which simply iterates over the given program array dispatching on each op code.</p><h4 id=\"memory-management\">Memory Management</h4><p>There are two copying collectors (one incremental) and one mark compact. I hope they can be used as examples for people who are curious about how garbage collection works. The garbage collectors all depend on <a href=\"https://github.com/clnhlzmn/CopperKitten/blob/master/runtime/gc_interface.h\">gc_interface.h</a> which declares a common set of functions with which the vm can interface with the heap memory. There are probably subtle bugs in the implementations of the garbage collectors. I am most confident in the correctness of the simple copying collector, least confident in the incremental copying collector, and the mark compact collector is somewhere in between.</p><h2 id=\"future-work\">Future Work</h2><p>This is work that I would like to do on this project in the future.</p><ul>  <li>    <p>clean up, organize, and simplify: compiler, assembler, and runtime source files</p>  </li>  <li>    <p>integrate programmer type annotations with type checker</p>  </li>  <li>    <p>strings and tuples</p>  </li>  <li>    <p>pattern matching on instances of user defined types</p>  </li>  <li>    <p>modules</p>  </li>  <li>    <p>implement parser and CLI in Kotlin (removing ANTLR and Apache CLI dependencies)</p>  </li>  <li>    <p>implement compiler and assembler in functional language like ML (or at least in a functional style in Kotlin)</p>  </li>  <li>    <p>implement compiler and assembler in CK</p>  </li>  <li>    <p>generate machine code rather than C99</p>  </li>  <li>    <p>optimize polymorphic functions to not always use boxed types for integers</p>  </li>  <li>    <p>lots of other optimizations</p>  </li></ul><p>Thanks for making it this far!
